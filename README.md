## 🙌 A Show of Myself !  
- 🎞️ As I said I'm a big fan of movies (especially from MCU) and a **film editing lover**.  
  ↓ So here's a link of my RedNote address, and you can see all my editing works and reletive photos.

  (Yeah you can see that I'm somehow crazy about the actor Sebastian Stan and his character, Bucky Barnes🦾, in MCU. Hope that's OK for you😊.)  
  ❤️‍🔥 If we have the same taste, welcome to follow my channel!   
- 🏞️ I'm also fond of **phtograpning**, and still learning it now.  
  And here're some of my works (Hope they're not that bad.)!
